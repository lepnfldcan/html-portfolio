<h1>Liam's All-Time Tavourite Movies</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 picks</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cloud Atlas (2012)</h3>
<p>In this mind-bending magnum opus by the Wachowski Siblings (The Matrix), we follow the stories of several souls reincarnated
    across space and time as they make life-altering decisions which change the course of human history.
    Spanning five centuries, this insanely ambitious roller-coaster of a film takes us from the slave trade of the south Pacific in the late
    1800's to a post-apocalyptic tribal civilization in Hawaii in the year 2321. Despite being polarizing, it holds up today as an undeniable cinematic acheivement.  </p>
<h3>The Talented Mr. Ripley (2003)</h3>
<p>The late Anthony Minghella reaches the height of his powers in this golden-age Miramax production.
    Based on the 1955 novel by Patricia Highsmith, Minghella crafts an incredibly clever film that is as moving
    as it is terrifying. Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, this slick, stylish, and unconventionally touching film features jaw-dropping performances
    by Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Matt Damon.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle (2004)</h3>
<p>In the deft hand of Hayao Miyazaki, this incredible film by the now fabled Studio Ghibli consistently ranks
    as one of the best nime ilms of all time. Miyazaki deals with timeless themes such as love, war, freedom, and the search
    for personal power and autonomy in a world choked by convention and political control. The stunning visuals are pure
    poetry and the soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi amplifies every moment, resulting in what is one of Ghibli's best pictures</p>
